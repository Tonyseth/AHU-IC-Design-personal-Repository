# 大二下期末英语听力汇总
## 第一篇
Big data is making its way into various industries, but its acceptance by the health care industry is surprisingly slow at a time when the industry is beset by multiple challenges.
大数据正逐步进入各个行业，但在面临多重挑战的情况下，医疗行业对大数据的接受速度却出人意料地缓慢。
Cost is one of these challenges. Today, the rising cost of health care is creating great financial stress for patients at a time when many are already in desperate need. Since hospitals are usually profit-driven, both doctor and patient may be more concerned with money issues than with health. From the point of view of government and policy, there needs to be some changes in the health care and health insurance systems. There needs to be a way to take some of the financial pressure off patients, doctors, and hospitals so that the patients' health — and not money — becomes the primary focus.
成本是这些挑战之一。如今，医疗成本的上升正给许多已经处于绝望状态的患者带来巨大的经济压力。由于医院通常是以盈利为目的，医生和患者可能更关心的是金钱问题而不是健康。从政府和政策的角度来看，医疗保健和医疗保险系统需要进行一些变革。需要有一种方法来减轻患者、医生和医院的经济压力，使患者的健康——而不是金钱——成为主要关注点。 
Big data can be used to reduce hospital waiting time, identify high-risk patients, and improve upon the creation and storage of patient records. These are all factors that can help to reduce costs for everyone involved.
大数据可以用来减少医院的等待时间，识别高风险患者，并改进患者记录的创建和存储。这些因素都可以帮助所有相关人员降低成本。
Patients today also enjoy higher levels of education, have easy access to high-level information through the Internet, and have greater expectations of their doctors. This is a second challenge that big data can help the health care industry to overcome. Big data can help to increase patient engagement and allow patients to track their own health indicators , through the use of wearable technology which can track and relay information about the patients' health to their physicians.
如今的患者也享受着更高水平的教育，通过互联网轻松获取高水平的信息，并对医生有更高的期望。这是大数据可以帮助医疗行业克服的第二个挑战。大数据可以通过可穿戴技术帮助增加患者的参与度，让患者能够追踪自己的健康指标，并将这些信息传递给他们的医生。

## 第二篇
Big data may be the watchword of the moment, but beneath the glitzy surface, it has its fair share of issues. Companies using big data must be able to deal with challenges regarding volume, veracity, and velocity.
大数据可能是当下的流行词，但在光鲜的表面下，它也有相当多的问题。使用大数据的公司必须能够应对与数据量、真实性和速度相关的挑战。

Volume: The term “big data” makes it clear that the size of the data being collected and studied is enormous. The huge volume of data being processed makes it unsuitable for traditional processing software. Storage for this data is also problematic. Facebook, for example, had to find a way to store 250 billion images back in 2013, and this number would only have grown since then.
数据量：“大数据”这个词表明，所收集和研究的数据量是巨大的。处理的大量数据使其不适合传统的处理软件。这些数据的存储也存在问题。例如，Facebook早在2013年就不得不找到一种方法来存储2500亿张图片，而且这个数字自那时以来只会继续增长。

Veracity: High-quality information must be obtained and analyzed correctly. A company that is hoping to use big data to gain meaningful information would need to analyze, record, and store data about both measurable and unmeasurable factors. For instance, using big data, a fashion label can try to track the popularity of a fashion trend by looking at the number of times it was mentioned online, but the usage of this term may not necessarily reflect how people actually feel about it.
真实性：必须正确获取和分析高质量的信息。希望使用大数据获取有意义信息的公司需要分析、记录和存储有关可测量和不可测量因素的数据。例如，通过使用大数据，时尚品牌可以试图通过在线提及次数来追踪时尚潮流的受欢迎程度，但该术语的使用未必反映了人们对它的实际感受。

Velocity: Companies must be able to deal with massive amounts of information coming in from a wide variety of sources at an incredibly fast speed. An effective use of big data would be for companies to make decisions or provide services that are based on accurate, real-time information.
速度：公司必须能够应对来自各种来源的海量信息，这些信息以极快的速度涌入。大数据的有效使用在于公司能够基于准确的实时信息做出决策或提供服务。

## 第三篇
Hello everyone! Today I' d like to speak to you about a new trend in information technology which is changing our lives: big data.
大家好！今天我想和大家谈谈一种正在改变我们生活的信息技术新趋势：大数据。

First, what is big data? Think of data as water. Most data is like a few drops of water, which are easy to see and count. Some data is like a cup of water or even a bucket of water, which can be measured and analyzed without much difficulty. Big data, on the other hand, is like a huge waterfall. Since so much water is rushing down at rapid speed, the water is hard to measure and impossible to contain. This is the kind of data we see rushing through the Internet every day. For example, WeChat has nearly 1 billion active users, sending 38 billion messages a day. And at any one moment, 272 million people are using QQ.
首先，什么是大数据？将数据比作水。大多数数据就像几滴水，容易看到和计数。有些数据像一杯水甚至一桶水，可以毫不费力地测量和分析。而大数据则像一个巨大的瀑布。由于水以极快的速度倾泻而下，难以测量且无法控制。这就是我们每天在互联网上看到的数据。例如，微信有近10亿活跃用户，每天发送380亿条消息。而在任何一个时刻，有2.72亿人在使用QQ。

This is such a huge amount of data that it is impossible to store, measure, and analyze the data by simply using traditional methods. For this reason, in recent years, high-tech companies have had to invent new technologies to deal with big data, including storage systems that can hold the data, high speed computers to process the data, and software systems for managing the data.
这是一个如此庞大的数据量，仅靠传统方法无法存储、测量和分析这些数据。为此，近年来，高科技公司不得不发明新技术来处理大数据，包括能够存储数据的存储系统、高速处理数据的计算机和管理数据的软件系统。

## 第四篇
Second, how is big data changing our lives? While big data is still young, it has already made its mark on product development. A large company can examine trends on Sina Weibo, for instance, to predict what products it should make. Advertisers can use social media to get a better understanding of how they can sell products. By analyzing data gathered from the Internet of Things — that is, from devices and machines which are connected to the Internet — manufacturers can improve their products so they do not break down as quickly or easily. Online supermarkets can study customer data to know what products will be in demand. Governments can analyze their data to better understand what policies to implement regarding the economy.
其次，大数据如何改变我们的生活？虽然大数据仍处于起步阶段，但它已经在产品开发方面留下了印记。例如，大公司可以通过新浪微博上的趋势来预测应该生产什么产品。广告商可以利用社交媒体更好地了解如何销售产品。通过分析从物联网（即连接到互联网的设备和机器）收集的数据，制造商可以改进其产品，使其不易损坏。在线超市可以研究客户数据，了解哪些产品将有需求。政府可以分析他们的数据，更好地了解在经济方面应实施哪些政策。

There are too many scientific applications of big data to list — ranging from unlocking our genetic code to studying the stars. One of the most exciting applications of big data is in the field of health care. Doctors can analyze data from wearable health care devices to get a better understanding of diseases and appropriate treatments.
大数据的科学应用太多了，无法一一列举——从解锁我们的基因密码到研究星星。大数据最令人兴奋的应用之一是医疗领域。医生可以分析可穿戴医疗设备的数据，以更好地了解疾病和适当的治疗方法。

As big data is still a relatively new field, there is no telling how it will be used in the future. What is clear, though, is that it is here to stay, and that it will become an increasingly important part in our lives.
由于大数据仍是一个相对较新的领域，无法预测未来它将如何被使用。然而，很明显，它将继续存在，并且会成为我们生活中越来越重要的一部分。

## 第五篇
Do you think Americans are more afraid of possible terrorist attacks or U.S. government corruption? If you guessed U.S. government corruption, you would be correct. It turns out that Americans are more afraid of U.S. government corruption than a possible terrorist attack!
你认为美国人更害怕可能的恐怖袭击还是美国政府的腐败？如果你猜是美国政府的腐败，你是对的。事实证明，美国人比可能的恐怖袭击更害怕美国政府的腐败！

At least that is what a Chapman University survey found. The university questioned 1,541 people across the country. The university survey grouped fear into 10 major categories. They include crime, personal anxieties, and technology. They also include both man-made and natural disasters.
至少这是查普曼大学的一项调查发现。该大学对全国1541人进行了调查。大学的调查将恐惧分为10大类。它们包括犯罪、个人焦虑和技术。它们还包括人为和自然灾害。

The researchers say that 58 percent of people they asked said they were either afraid or very afraid of corruption by government officials. 44.4 percent fear man-made disasters, like terrorist attacks. Government corruption tops the list of 88 possible fears and anxieties that people were asked about. The rest of the top 10 fears include the corporate tracking of personal information, terrorist attacks, government tracking of personal information, biological warfare, identity theft, economic collapse, running out of money, and credit card fraud.
研究人员表示，他们询问的人中有58%表示害怕或非常害怕政府官员的腐败。44.4%的人害怕人为灾难，如恐怖袭击。政府腐败在88个可能的恐惧和焦虑列表中排名第一。其余前十大恐惧包括公司跟踪个人信息、恐怖袭击、政府跟踪个人信息、生物战、身份盗窃、经济崩溃、钱用光和信用卡欺诈。

The survey shows people are more afraid of man-made disasters than natural disasters. When it comes to natural disasters, the ones most-feared are pandemics — not hurricanes or earthquakes. Fear of reptiles, like snakes, tops the list of personal anxieties. When the subject is daily life, death is what people fear most. Also, some on the list of fears were not so surprising, like war, insects, loneliness, the dark, and a fear of heights.
调查显示，人们对人为灾难的恐惧多于自然灾难。说到自然灾难，最令人恐惧的是大流行病——而不是飓风或地震。对爬行动物（如蛇）的恐惧在个人焦虑列表中排名第一。当主题是日常生活时，人们最害怕的是死亡。此外，名单上的一些恐惧并不那么令人惊讶，比如战争、昆虫、孤独、黑暗和对高度的恐惧。

## 第六篇
Do you often feel undeserving of your success? Do you often believe that luck, hard work, or some other external factor plays the largest role in your success, but you or your skills are irrelevant?
你是否经常觉得自己不配拥有成功？你是否经常认为运气、努力或其他外部因素在你的成功中起到了最大的作用，而你或你的技能无关紧要？

If so, you may be suffering from the impostor syndrome — a psychological habit where a person persistently feels that he or she is only pretending to be skilled or accomplished, in spite of evidence that shows otherwise. These people often feel as though their success is due to luck or hard work, and that it does not reflect their “true” abilities.
如果是这样，你可能患有冒名顶替综合症——一种心理习惯，即一个人持续觉得自己只是假装有技能或有成就，尽管有证据表明情况并非如此。这些人经常觉得他们的成功是由于运气或努力，而不是反映他们的“真正”能力。

People with this habit are likely to find it difficult to make real connections with other people, since they feel like impostors pretending to be better or more successful versions of themselves. While others can receive support by opening up about their worries and fears, those suffering from the impostor syndrome often do not do so. Each success increases their pressure to perform, and the fear of being exposed as a fraud causes them to keep quiet about their worries, and to work harder to maintain this “illusion”.
有这种习惯的人可能很难与他人建立真正的联系，因为他们觉得自己像个冒牌货，假装成更好或更成功的自己。虽然其他人可以通过公开自己的担忧和恐惧来获得支持，但那些患有冒名顶替综合症的人通常不会这样做。每一次成功都会增加他们的表现压力，害怕被揭穿为欺诈者会让他们对自己的担忧保持沉默，并努力工作以维持这种“错觉”。

Though people suffering from this syndrome may feel isolated, the truth is that they are not alone in the slightest. In Blind, an anonymous social network for the workplace, 1 out of every 2 people, out of over 10,000 survey respondents, reported that they suffered from the impostor syndrome. As with many other problems, admitting the existence of an unhealthy habit can be the first step on the long road to recovery. With the support of the people around us, and by doing our best to look at skills and achievements objectively, we can combat these feelings of insecurity.
尽管患有这种综合症的人可能会感到孤立，但事实是他们一点也不孤单。在一个名为Blind的匿名职场社交网络中，在超过10,000名受访者中，每两个人中就有一人报告说他们患有冒名顶替综合症。与许多其他问题一样，承认不健康习惯的存在可能是走向康复的第一步。在我们周围人的支持下，尽最大努力客观地看待技能和成就，我们可以对抗这些不安全感。

### Questions:
**What is the key reason for their success according to people with the impostor syndrome?**
A: Internal factors.
==B: External factors.==
C: Luck.
D: Their skills.

**What do people with the impostor syndrome think of their abilities?**
A: Their abilities are greater than that which was indicated by their success.
B: Their abilities are equal to that which was indicated by their success.
==C: Their abilities are less than that which was indicated by their success.==
D: They have no abilities that could have led to success.

**What do people with the impostor syndrome tend to do?**
A: Seek advice from others.
B: Confide to friends their worries.
C: Find the true meaning of success.
==D: Work harder to succeed.==

## 第七篇
One of the most devastating events that can occur to a person is to be rejected. People who are rejected naturally feel lonely, angry, and hostile. They often blame themselves and lose confidence. And rejection can result in more than just psychological damage. Studies have shown that it can affect people mentally, temporarily lowering their intelligence. What is more, the pain of rejection triggers some of the same parts of the brain that deal with physical pain, so the pain we feel from rejection is very, very real.
对于一个人来说，最具毁灭性的事件之一就是被拒绝。被拒绝的人自然会感到孤独、愤怒和敌对。他们经常责怪自己并失去信心。而且，拒绝不仅仅会造成心理上的伤害。研究表明，它还会对人的精神状态产生影响，暂时降低他们的智力。此外，拒绝带来的痛苦会触发大脑中处理身体疼痛的某些部分，因此我们从拒绝中感受到的痛苦是非常真实的。

Sadly, many people find overcoming rejection quite difficult. They may already know that it was not their fault that they were rejected, and know that they should believe in themselves, and yet they continue to blame themselves and lack confidence.
可悲的是，许多人发现克服拒绝是相当困难的。他们可能已经知道被拒绝并不是他们的错，也知道他们应该相信自己，但他们仍然继续责怪自己并缺乏信心。

So what is the solution, then?
那么，解决方案是什么呢？

One person who is showing the way for people to overcome rejection is Jia Jiang, who has given a TED Talk on this issue that has clocked over 4.5 million views thus far. Jia Jiang has also written a best-selling book on the subject.
有一个人正在为人们克服拒绝指引方向，那就是蒋佳，他在这个问题上发表了一次TED演讲，到目前为止已经有超过450万次观看。蒋佳还就这个主题写了一本畅销书。

On the surface, Jia Jiang seems an unlikely person to have suffered from rejection. Born in Beijing, China, he went to university in the United States, obtained an MBA, and became a business executive. However, like many people, he allowed rejection to rule his life. This began when he was six years old, when he became embarrassed at school because no one in his class could think of a kind word to say about him. He later discovered that despite having big dreams of business success, feelings of rejection always held him back.
表面上看，蒋佳似乎不太可能经历过拒绝。他出生在中国北京，在美国上大学，获得了MBA学位，并成为了一名企业高管。然而，像许多人一样，他让拒绝统治了他的生活。这始于他六岁时，当时在学校因为班上没有人能想到一句好话来形容他而感到尴尬。后来他发现，尽管他有着商业成功的宏大梦想，但拒绝的感觉总是阻碍他前进。

The turning point for Jiang came when he decided to start his own company. At that time, he thought that he was easily going to get investment money for the company from people he knew, but unfortunately these people all turned him down, and so his dream died. He felt stung by rejection. However, instead of letting this rejection defeat him, he decided to find a way to overcome it, and so he began to do research on ways to cope with rejection.
蒋佳的转折点是当他决定创办自己的公司时。那时，他认为可以轻松地从认识的人那里获得公司的投资资金，但不幸的是，这些人都拒绝了他，因此他的梦想破灭了。他感到被拒绝刺痛了。然而，他没有让这种拒绝打败他，而是决定找到一种方法来克服它，于是他开始研究应对拒绝的方法。

## 第八篇
During his research, Jiang came across rejectiontherapy.com, a website which was run by Jason Comely. Comely believed that the best way of overcoming rejection was to constantly seek it out, and thus become less sensitive to it. Jiang decided that he would try this strategy, so he planned to find a way to be rejected by someone every day for the next one hundred days, by making strange or impossible requests. He would then film his encounters and post them online as a video blog. His first challenge was to borrow $100 from a stranger, so he approached a large man and asked him for money. The man said “No,” and then asked him why he wanted the money. But Jiang was so afraid that he ran away without answering. Watching the video later, Jiang noticed that the man was not angry at him, and actually seemed like a nice person. It struck Jiang that he made a mistake by running away, and that he should have stayed and faced up to his fear.
在他的研究过程中，蒋佳偶然发现了rejectiontherapy.com，这是一个由Jason Comely运营的网站。Comely认为克服拒绝的最好方法是不断寻求拒绝，从而变得不那么敏感。蒋佳决定尝试这个策略，所以他计划在接下来的100天里，每天都找到一种被人拒绝的方式，通过提出奇怪或不可能的要求。他会拍摄他的遭遇并将其作为视频博客发布在网上。他的第一个挑战是向陌生人借100美元，所以他走近一个大汉并向他要钱。那个人说“不”，然后问他为什么要钱。但是蒋佳太害怕了，没有回答就跑开了。后来回看视频时，蒋佳注意到那个人并没有对他生气，实际上看起来是个好人。蒋佳意识到自己逃跑是个错误，他应该留下来面对自己的恐惧。

On his second day, he succeeded at being rejected when he asked for a free burger at a fast food restaurant. However, on his third day, something amazing happened: He failed to be rejected. He had set out to have a donut shop make him a donut in the shape of the Olympic Rings, something which he thought was impossible. However, not only did the donut shop make the donut as he requested, but the manager gave it to him for free. In the days that followed, he had similar failures at being rejected. Through his failures and successes, he gained confidence and learned some important strategies:
在他的第二天，当他在一家快餐店要求免费汉堡时，他成功地被拒绝了。然而，在第三天，发生了一件了不起的事情：他没有被拒绝。他原本打算让一家甜甜圈店为他制作一个奥运五环形状的甜甜圈，这是他认为不可能的事情。然而，甜甜圈店不仅按照他的要求制作了甜甜圈，经理还免费送给他。在接下来的日子里，他在被拒绝方面有过类似的失败。通过他的失败和成功，他获得了信心并学到了一些重要策略：

First, don' t run away from rejection — embrace it. Only by embracing rejection can we turn it into an opportunity.
首先，不要逃避拒绝——接受它。只有接受拒绝，我们才能把它变成机会。

Second, when someone rejects you, always ask them “Why?” They may have a good reason for telling you “No,” and they may also be able to point you in the direction of someone who can help you.
第二，当有人拒绝你时，一定要问他们“为什么？”他们可能有一个拒绝你的好理由，并且他们也可能会指引你去找可以帮助你的人。

Finally, when you see someone hesitating, acknowledge their doubts. For example, Jia Jiang once asked a store manager to let him do something that seemed strange. The man hesitated and looked doubtful, so Jia Jiang asked the man, “Is that strange?” When he acknowledged that the request seemed strange, the man relaxed, and gave him what he wanted.
最后，当你看到有人犹豫时，承认他们的疑虑。例如，蒋佳曾经要求一家店的经理让他做一些看起来很奇怪的事情。那个人犹豫并且看起来充满疑虑，所以蒋佳问那个人，“这很奇怪吗？”当他承认请求看起来很奇怪时，那个人放松了，并给了他他想要的东西。

To sum up, rejection does not define who you are — you are defined by how you react to rejection.
总而言之，拒绝并不定义你是谁——你由你如何应对拒绝来定义。

## 第九篇
The idea of what kinds of food we will be eating in the future is interesting to explore. Meat production is a huge and expensive industry. Vegetarian products, on the other hand, are cheaper to produce and tend to be healthier as well. Soy products, that is, products made from soy beans, have a texture that is very similar to meat and can provide a wide variety of flavor. Today, you will be able to find vegetable burgers with “meat” patties made entirely from plants. However, many people are carnivorous. We like meat. Sometimes, we want a burger that began as a cow. Fortunately, for both our wallets and the environment, science is working to satisfy this primitive desire without an actual animal being harmed in the process. In vitro, or cultured, meat involves “growing” meat. This method involves taking cells from a live animal and growing meat from these cells. This idea is still in the research stage.
我们未来会吃什么样的食物，这个想法很有趣。肉类生产是一个庞大且昂贵的行业。另一方面，素食产品的生产成本较低，而且往往更健康。大豆制品，即由大豆制成的产品，其质地与肉类非常相似，并且可以提供多种风味。如今，你可以找到完全由植物制成的“肉”饼的蔬菜汉堡。然而，许多人是食肉动物。我们喜欢肉。有时，我们想要一个从牛开始的汉堡。幸运的是，为了我们的钱包和环境，科学正在努力满足这种原始的欲望，而无需伤害实际的动物。体外或培养肉涉及“培养”肉。这种方法涉及从活体动物中提取细胞，并从这些细胞中生长肉。这种想法仍处于研究阶段。

Just 50 years ago, farmers used scientifically-altered seeds, hybrids and new types of fertilizers to enhance crops. As a result, farmers were able to grow twice as much as before. The downside of this was the need for more land and water. How this will prove to be sustainable in the future, is another question that many scientists are grappling with.
就在50年前，农民们使用科学改良的种子、杂交品种和新型肥料来提高作物产量。因此，农民能够种植的产量是以前的两倍。这种方法的缺点是需要更多的土地和水。这种方法在未来能否证明是可持续的，是许多科学家正在努力解决的另一个问题。

Food producers have also had to figure out how to grow food in some unlikely places. Enter algae. Algae are microscopic organisms that have the ability to grow very fast. Seaweed, in fact, is a form of algae. Algae can grow in the sea and even in polluted water. With more research, we might be able to cultivate hundreds of types of edible algae that could serve as an accessible and affordable food option for the future.
食品生产者还必须研究如何在一些不太可能的地方种植食物。进入藻类。藻类是能够快速生长的微生物。事实上，海藻是一种藻类。藻类可以在海中生长，甚至可以在受污染的水中生长。通过更多的研究，我们可能能够培养数百种可食用的藻类，这些藻类可以作为未来可获得且经济实惠的食物选择。

## 第十篇

Access to food is one of the basic needs of humanity. But the supply of food is under threat. Since 2005, the average price of food has doubled. The International Food Policy Research Institute says a major reason for this is poor quality and management of land.
获取食物是人类的基本需求之一。但食品供应正面临威胁。自2005年以来，食品的平均价格翻了一番。国际食品政策研究所表示，其主要原因是土地质量和管理不善。

However, the food-supply system is under threat, not because there' s a lack of food, but because food is not well distributed. In some areas, we have too much food being produced, but in other areas, there' s a scarcity. People in these latter areas are using as much as 70% of their earnings to buy food. Many of those that go hungry are small-scale farmers. The key to improving food distribution might be to help people living in areas hit by scarcity to grow more food.
然而，食品供应系统受到威胁，并不是因为缺乏食物，而是因为食物分配不均。在某些地区，我们生产的食物过多，但在其他地区，却存在短缺。这些地区的人们将多达70%的收入用于购买食物。许多挨饿的人是小规模农民。改善食品分配的关键可能是帮助生活在短缺地区的人们种植更多的食物。

Another problem contributing to food shortages is the increasing number of mouths to feed. The UN predicts that the world' s population will increase by 25% in the next 25 years. We can expect an increase of over 2 billion people living on the planet by 2050. One solution that might help to slow this increase is better education and better health care. One of the benefits of better health care is a decline in the infant mortality rate. When the infant mortality rate is high, people resort to having more children because they don' t know how many would die before the age of 3 or 5.
另一个导致食品短缺的问题是需要养活的人口数量不断增加。联合国预测，未来25年世界人口将增长25%。预计到2050年，地球上将增加20多亿人。一个可能有助于减缓这一增长的解决方案是改善教育和医疗保健。更好的医疗保健的一个好处是婴儿死亡率的下降。当婴儿死亡率高时，人们倾向于生育更多的孩子，因为他们不知道有多少孩子会在3岁或5岁之前死亡。

Food production can be a sensitive matter, especially in hard times, such as when droughts occur. Some countries are reluctant to share information, but globalization is calling for more cooperation. It is important that all nations share information and resources in order to tackle the food crisis in the world.
食品生产可能是一个敏感问题，尤其是在干旱等困难时期。有些国家不愿共享信息，但全球化呼吁更多的合作。所有国家共享信息和资源以解决世界粮食危机非常重要。

## 第十一篇

One growing problem in China has been desertification. This is when normally productive land becomes a desert, and so becomes lost to agriculture. Since north China borders desert areas, this is an area that is already somewhat dry, having long seasons of little rain. A variety of factors have caused these desert areas to grow. The primary issue has been the cutting down of trees for building materials or fuel, and the clearing of land for farming. In addition, once land is cleared for farming, quite often crops which are inappropriate for the dry environment are planted. Desert areas in China have grown on average nearly 3,400 square kilometers a year, and China now has 54,000 more square kilometers of desert than it did in 1975.
中国日益严重的问题之一是荒漠化。这是指通常生产力很高的土地变成沙漠，从而丧失农业用途。由于中国北部与沙漠地区接壤，这一地区本来就比较干燥，雨季很短。多种因素导致了这些沙漠地区的扩大。主要问题是为了建材或燃料而砍伐树木，以及为了农业而清理土地。此外，一旦土地被清理出来进行农业种植，通常会种植一些不适合干旱环境的作物。中国的沙漠地区平均每年增加近3,400平方公里，自1975年以来，中国的沙漠面积增加了54,000平方公里。

Desertification is a serious environmental issue because once the process of desertification starts it can be quite hard to stop, and more and more land will be wasted. Further, huge storms carrying sand from these desert areas have made the air difficult and dangerous to breathe and damaging to people' s lungs. Since so many trees have already been cut down, China has also had to import wood from other countries. An even bigger issue is that these desert lands can no longer be used for traditional agriculture.
荒漠化是一个严重的环境问题，因为一旦荒漠化过程开始，它就很难停止，越来越多的土地会被浪费。此外，从这些沙漠地区带来的大风沙暴使空气变得难以呼吸且对人的肺部有害。由于已经砍伐了大量的树木，中国还不得不从其他国家进口木材。更大的问题是这些沙漠土地不再适合传统农业。

One solution to the problem of desertification — a solution that both recovers the land and provides food — is the development of dry land agriculture.
解决荒漠化问题的一个方案——一个既能恢复土地又能提供食物的方案——是发展旱地农业。

## 第十二篇
The main issue involved with dry land agriculture is that the ground is mostly sand with a thin layer of good soil on top of it. This layer of good soil can easily be carried away by wind and water erosion, so it must be carefully protected.
旱地农业的主要问题在于，地面主要是沙子，上面有一层薄薄的良好土壤。这层好土壤很容易被风和水侵蚀带走，因此必须小心保护。

Fortunately, much of the dry land in China is hilly. Terraced farming is therefore the most appropriate technique for these areas. With terraced farming, flat, level areas are cut into the side of a hill. Low walls are built to avoid having water run off and take some of the good soil with it.
幸运的是，中国的大部分旱地是丘陵，因此梯田耕作是这些地区最适合的技术。通过梯田耕作，将平坦的区域切割到山坡上。建造低矮的墙壁以防止水流失并带走一些好土壤。

In flat lands, the best solution is to grow crops in long, low hills of soil, which are covered in a plastic film. Small holes are cut into the plastic film for the crops to grow through. The plastic film helps keep water in the ground and prevents soil from being blown or washed away. This kind of farming also requires much less water than traditional farming.
在平坦的土地上，最好的解决方案是在长长的低矮土丘中种植作物，并用塑料薄膜覆盖。塑料薄膜上切有小孔，供作物生长。塑料薄膜有助于保持土壤中的水分，防止土壤被风吹走或水冲走。这种耕作比传统耕作需要的水更少。

Finally, the choice of crops for dry land agriculture is important. Crops that do not need as much water are an obvious choice. These crops must also yield profits for farmers, because if the crops do not produce a good income, farmers have little reason to plant them. With this in mind, dry land farming in China often involves wheat and potato crops. However, Chinese agricultural experts are now taking a closer look at corn. Corn requires more water, but it is very profitable. The straw from the corn plants can also be used to feed cattle, and to protect and enrich the soil.
最后，选择适合旱地农业的作物非常重要。显而易见，需水量不大的作物是首选。这些作物还必须为农民带来利润，因为如果作物不能带来良好的收入，农民就没有理由种植它们。有鉴于此，中国的旱地农业通常涉及小麦和土豆作物。然而，中国的农业专家现在正密切关注玉米。玉米需要更多的水，但它非常有利可图。玉米秸秆也可以用来喂养牲畜，保护和丰富土壤。

While the challenges presented by desertification are clear, Chinese agricultural experts are working hard to build a future that is environmentally sustainable and profitable for farmers, while ensuring that China' s population is well fed.
尽管荒漠化带来的挑战显而易见，但中国的农业专家正努力建设一个对环境可持续、对农民有利可图的未来，同时确保中国人口得到良好供养。
